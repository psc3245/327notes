Inheritance / polymorphism
- types of inheritance (public, protected, private)
- polymorphism references/pointers/objects
- slicing
- virtual functions
	- how to simulate an interface
- Calling base class
- polymorphism


C++ make files (mostly same as c)
Constructors ( classes and objects defining)
- copy constructor (special)
- operator =
- destructor
const
operator overloading
references
objects on stack

Design patterns
- singleton
- strategy - composition vs inheritance
- observer
struct bit fields
union
c++ type casting
default parameters
initializers
c++ I/O (streams)
member access restrictions - (public, protected, private)

Memory management
- reference counting
- mark & sweep
- copying garbage collector

Templates
- class
- function
- specialization
